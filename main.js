I have this error in console:
Uncaught(in promise) DOMException: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first.
restartMusic @main.js: 10
 (anonymous) @main.js: 17
There is my javascript code:
const music = new Audio('./assets/sounds/monitorBeep.mp3');

function stopMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.pause();
}

function restartMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.play();
 music.volume = 0.7;
}
music.addEventListener('ended', function () {
 restartMusic();
});

restartMusic();

console.log('test');
And there is my index.html:

The error you're encountering, "play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first, " is due to restrictions in some browsers that prevent automatic playback of audio or video without any user interaction.

To resolve this issue, you can modify your code to ensure that the audio is played only upon user interaction with the document, such as a click event.One way to achieve this is by adding an event listener to an element in the document, and then triggering the audio play function within that event listener.

 Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
const music = new Audio('./assets/sounds/monitorBeep.mp3');
let musicStarted = false;

function stopMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.pause();
}

function restartMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.play();
 music.volume = 0.7;
}

function startMusicOnInteraction() {
 if (!musicStarted) {
  restartMusic();
  musicStarted = true;
 }
}

// Add event listener to the document or a specific element
document.addEventListener('click', startMusicOnInteraction);

music.addEventListener('ended', function () {
 restartMusic();
});

console.log('test');
In this modified code, the startMusicOnInteraction function is triggered when a click event occurs anywhere in the document.The music will start playing upon this user interaction.This method should help bypass the browser's restrictions on autoplay.

Remember to adjust the event(e.g., 'click') or the targeted element(e.g., a specific button) based on your specific use case and where you want the user interaction to initiate the audio playback.

But I want to start music automaticly when page is loade in browser
ChatGPT
To automatically play audio upon page load, some browsers have restrictions that prevent autoplay to provide a better user experience(especially for those who find autoplay annoying). To get around this, you'll need to employ workarounds that allow for automatic playback in certain situations.

One workaround involves initiating playback in response to a user - driven event(like a click).However, there's another method using the Promise returned by play() to handle autoplay when the audio is ready. Here's how you can modify your code to potentially overcome the autoplay restrictions:

javascript
Copy code
const music = new Audio('./assets/sounds/monitorBeep.mp3');
let musicStarted = false;

function stopMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.pause();
}

function restartMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.play().then(() => {
  // Autoplay started successfully
  music.volume = 0.7;
  musicStarted = true;
 }).catch(error => {
  // Autoplay was prevented
  console.log('Autoplay was prevented:', error);
  // In case autoplay was prevented, set up an event listener for user interaction
  document.addEventListener('click', startMusicOnInteraction);
 });
}

function startMusicOnInteraction() {
 if (!musicStarted) {
  restartMusic();
 }
}

music.addEventListener('ended', function () {
 restartMusic();
});

restartMusic();

console.log('test');
This modified code attempts to play the audio automatically.If the autoplay is prevented, it logs an error to the console and adds an event listener to the document for user interaction.Once the user interacts(e.g., clicks), it triggers the audio playback.

Please note that even with these workarounds, browser updates or user settings might still interfere with autoplay behavior.Always inform users about audio or video content starting on page load to ensure a better user experience.

Now I have this text in console:
Autoplay was prevented: DOMException: play() failed because the user didn't interact with the document first.

It seems like the autoplay is still being prevented due to the browser's restrictions. This limitation is in place to improve user experience by avoiding unexpected audio or video playback on websites.

Given this situation, the approach to trigger audio on page load might not work due to the browser's policies.

However, you can try another approach that involves playing the audio immediately after a user interaction.For example, you can create a button or a specific element on your page, and once the user interacts with it(like clicking), the audio will start playing.Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
const music = new Audio('./assets/sounds/monitorBeep.mp3');
let musicStarted = false;

function stopMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.pause();
}

function restartMusic() {
 music.currentTime = 0;
 music.play().then(() => {
  // Autoplay started successfully
  music.volume = 0.7;
  musicStarted = true;
 }).catch(error => {
  // Autoplay was prevented
  console.log('Autoplay was prevented:', error);
 });
}

function startMusicOnInteraction() {
 if (!musicStarted) {
  restartMusic();
  document.removeEventListener('click', startMusicOnInteraction); // Remove the listener after initial interaction
 }
}

document.addEventListener('click', startMusicOnInteraction);

music.addEventListener('ended', function () {
 restartMusic();
});

console.log('test');
